# Flask Template

This is a template for a python flask that runs right out of the box

**Clone the repo to your desired location on your PC with the following command:**
```
https://github.com/hellfire989/flask-template.git
```

Open any editor of your choosing, or just a plain CMD if you some how don't have one.

**Install the required dependencies (There are some useful extra one's added in here as well):**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Lastly, open a terminal on it's own or one built into your browser, and run the final command:**
```
python app.py
```

Your Flask app should now be running! Your console should've displayed something similar to this:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 ```
